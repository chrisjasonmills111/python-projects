## Vulnerability Response 🛠️

Promptly addressing vulnerabilities is a priority. Severity guides our response. Updates on progress and resolution timelines will be provided regularly.

Accepted vulnerabilities lead to developing patches or security updates. Once ready, a new version will address reported vulnerabilities.

Out-of-scope vulnerabilities will be explained. Please note that addressing all reports may not be feasible if they fall beyond our project's scope.

We value the security community's contribution to safeguarding our users. Thank you for your efforts! 👏

## Security Updates 🚀

Ensure project security by staying updated. Regularly check the "python-projects" releases page owned by "mrayanasim" for updates. Follow the instructions in the release notes for upgrades.

Note that outdated versions may lack security updates and are vulnerable to known exploits. Upgrade to a supported version for security.

**Note: Tailor this security policy template to your project's specific needs.**
